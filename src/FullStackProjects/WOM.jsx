          I decided to build this piece because, in my current position, our
          work order system is terribly disorganized. It's comprised of an excel
          file hosted in teams, and relies on the user to email the technicians,
          and then update the work order log manually.
        </div>
        <div className="projectsubheading">Front End</div>
        <div>
          The work order management system frontend is built with React and
          Material-UI. The login uses BCrypt.NET for password hashing but
          currently doesnâ€™t include email verification or 2FA. The dashboard
          features a searchable, sortable table and filters for active or
          inactive work orders. Users can create or edit work orders through
          modal forms, mark them complete, and upload related photos. The focus
          so far has been on solid functionality rather than polished design.
        </div>
        <div className="projectsubheading">Back End</div>
        <div>
          The backend is developed in .NET with Entity Framework for ORM and
          uses a SQLite database for data storage. It handles CRUD operations
          for work orders, processes user requests, and manages secure file
          uploads for work order photos. Automated email notifications are sent
          using System.Net.Mail. Security includes protected routes in React,
          hashed passwords with BCrypt.NET, and session tokens for authenticated
          user access.
