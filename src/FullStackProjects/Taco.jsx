        For this project, I chose to try Angular instead of my usual React
        stack. I wanted hands-on experience since my college team spoke highly
        of it. While I found Angular less intuitive than React, using TypeScript
        helped me build cleaner patterns for passing data and strengthened my
        JavaScript fundamentals.
      </div>
      <div className="projectsubheading">Front End</div>
      <div>
        The front end was really fun to work on, as Angular makes generating
        front end componenets really easy. On top of that, I really enjoyed the
        way Angular has a great methodology of seperation of concerns. Each
        component has it's own CSS, HTML, and Typescript file. This helped me
        conceptualize each component a littl easier than when i've built
        projects using React.

        For the backend, I focused on adding a payment feature I hadnâ€™t tackled
        before. I chose Stripe for its solid API and flexible integration
        options. I implemented an embedded Stripe checkout page but explored
        other approaches, from simple redirects to more advanced custom flows.
